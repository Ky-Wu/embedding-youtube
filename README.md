#Learning how to embed Youtube Videos

This project was created as an attempt to practice embedding video, specifically Youtube videos in this case, into an HTML document. This project is not meant to be used in any commercial manner and was created only to practice using CSS, which I will despise using despite its ubiquity. Perhaps I will learn to put aside my hatred when I (hopefully) master it one day. Maybe one day.

##This project was made to practice the following:

-Structuring an HTML document (obviously)
-Stylizing navigation bars and sidebars using CSS
-Embedding videos and pictures into an HTML document
