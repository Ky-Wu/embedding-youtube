#Learning how to embed Youtube Videos

This project was created as an attempt to practice embedding video, specifically Youtube videos in this case, into an HTML document. This project is not meant to be used in any commercial manner and was created only to practice using CSS, which I will despise using despite its ubiquity. Perhaps I will learn to put aside my hatred when I (hopefully) master it one day. Maybe one day.

Many links are broken and some features are missing because this is a CSS project, and thus I focused mainly on CSS rather than actual functionality or javascript. If you want to view this project online, please go to https://www.Ky-Wu.github.io/embedding-youtube
##This project was made to practice the following:

-Structuring an HTML document (obviously)
-Stylizing navigation bars and sidebars using CSS
-Embedding videos and pictures into an HTML documen
-Imitate Youtube's style using basic CSS
