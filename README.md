# Learning how to embed Youtube Videos

This project was created as an attempt to practice embedding video, specifically Youtube videos in this case, into an HTML document. This project is not meant to be used in any commercial manner and was created only to practice using CSS, which I will despise using despite its ubiquity. Perhaps I will learn to put aside my hatred when I (hopefully) master it one day. Maybe one day.

Many links and icons are broken and some features are missing because this is a CSS project, and thus I focused mainly on CSS rather than actual functionality or javascript. Youtube's website is so nice because (among other things) they used javascript to dynamically change the look of the website as you change the dimensions of the browser as well as change the page whenever you click on specific icons. I have not added any javascript in this project, so some icons won't do anything and there are horrible scaling issues. It is best to view this project with a full screen browser. Please instead admire the CSS styling and the HTML document (which I made from scratch). If you want to view this project online, please go to https://www.ky-wu.github.io/embedding-youtube

I included some of my favorite Youtube videos of all time because I hope whoever's reading this at least gains something out of looking at this project. I also linked each thumbnail and video title to their respective videos on Youtube so you could be on the actual site and watch them there.

## This project was made to practice the following:

-Structuring an HTML document (obviously)

-Stylizing navigation bars and sidebars using CSS

-Embedding videos and pictures into an HTML document

-Imitate Youtube's style using basic CSS

-Understand the black magic behind manipulating HTML divs to actually place content in the correct spot
